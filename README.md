### Applied Computational Genomics Course at UU: Spring 2020
- Faculty: Aaron Quinlan (aquinlan at genetics.utah.edu)
- Teaching assistants: Michael Cormier (cormiermichaelj @ gmail.com), Katie Owings (katie.owings @ utah.edu), Ryan Miller (miller.ryan.h @ gmail.com), and Mark Wadsworth (mew225 @ gmail.com)
- Meets Tu and Th from 9:10-10:30 in EIHG Auditorium; January 7 - April 21
- TA Hours: Monday and Wednesday, 10-11am, HSEB

### Overview
This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental concepts and experimental approaches in the analysis and interpretation of experimental genomics data. It will be structured as a series of lectures covering key concepts and analytical strategies. A diverse range of biological questions enabled by modern DNA sequencing technologies will be explored including sequence alignment, the identification of genetic variation, structural variation, and ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. Students will learn and apply the fundamental data formats and analysis strategies that underlie computational genomics research. **The primary goal of the course is for students to be grounded in theory and leave the course empowered to conduct independent genomic analyses.**

### Grading policy
All assignments are due on the date stated in class. Ten percent of the grade will be deducted for each 24 hours that the assignment is late.

### Stats course at the U

greg Stoddard's class was aimed towards basic bio and clinical research. it was fine but used stata
PBHLT 7100 - biostatistics 2
There is an R-based stats class called Advanced Stastical Modeling for Biologists but it is designed for people who haven't used R and is basic ways to model stats, Don Feener
